Python3 CLI tool for interacting with [Filecoin PoRep Market](https://github.com/fidlabs/porep-market) smart contracts
using [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/#), [Web3](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/). \
Developed for admins, clients, and SPs to **manage their market interactions** from command line.

## Installation

**Use python >= 3.10**

```bash
python3 --version  # check your python version
git clone https://github.com/fidlabs/filecoin-porep-market-tooling && cd filecoin-porep-market-tooling  # clone the repo
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # install dependencies
cp .env.mainnet .env  # create your local .env file
chmod 600 .env  # optional, but recommended for security: restrict access to the .env file
```

## Running the CLI

Make sure you have the required environment variables set (see `.env`). \
Run the script: `python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py` and follow help prompts.

## Important notes

- The app **does not store any state** locally - all state is retrieved from the blockchain by design.
- The app stores all blockchain transaction logs to `logs/`.
- Default behaviour is to wait for each transaction to succeed after sending it.
- The app operates on **FEVM smart contracts** (thus EVM 0x-addresses) but **fully supports Filecoin f-addresses / Actor IDs** with proper conversion.
- There are multiple ways of providing the user's private key for blockchain transactions and the priority is as follows:
    1. `[ADMIN|CLIENT|SP]_PRIVATE_KEY` variable in the system environment variables or in the local `.env` file,
    2. `[ADMIN|CLIENT|SP]_LOTUS_WALLET` and `[ADMIN|CLIENT|SP]_LOTUS_TOKEN` variables when using Lotus wallet,
    3. if non of those are set, the app will prompt the user to input the private key for required operations in a secure manner.
- Read-only commands do not require private key / lotus wallet set, though some of them require user's address (`client --address` and `sp --organization`).
- Rule of thumb: the private key / lotus wallet you set is the one that signs and sends transactions, \
  so always use the one with correct permissions / approvals / rights for the transaction you want to send.
- Make sure the address for blockchain transactions you use has enough FIL for gas fees and is **initialized on the Filecoin network**.
- The app prints output of read-only commands in json format to be easily parsable by other tools.
- PoRep Market smart contracts supports only 32 GiB sectors.
- PoRep Market smart contracts assumes a month is always 30 days.

## Security considerations

- All blockchain transactions **require manual user confirmation** before sending. There is no option to override this. \
  If you decline the final confirmation, the command falls back to dry-run behavior without broadcasting the transaction.
- The app runs locally and does not transmit any data to external servers besides blockchain.
  All interactions are between the user's machine and the provided `RPC_URL` blockchain.
- The app does not log any sensitive information to the console or to the log files.
  All transaction logs are stored without any sensitive information.
- When using Lotus wallet for blockchain transaction signing, the **private key never leaves the Lotus wallet** and is not exposed to the CLI app. \
  This is the recommended way of using the app.

## Typical SP workflow

1. Follow the [Installation](#installation) steps.

2. Steps 3-5 below are required for SP to make blockchain _write_ transactions (such as `sp register-offer`).
   You won't need this in a typical SP flow.

3. **IMPORTANT**: interaction with the chain requires the private key for the message sender,
   so for security do not use your miner wallet for sending commands to the PoRep Market. \
   Instead, you will need to create a _miner controller_ wallet. If you already have one and want to reuse it, that’s fine. \
   However, to follow best security practices, we recommend you create a new wallet and register it as a _controller wallet_
   for all the miners you will be using in the PoRep Market. \
   The PoRep Market then uses controller status to verify that the command sender is authorised to send commands on behalf of your miner. \
   Follow the steps here:
   [https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/addresses/#control-addresses](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/addresses/#control-addresses)

4. Export the private key of your newly created wallet:

   ```bash
   lotus wallet export <your-controller-address> | xxd -r -p | jq -r '.PrivateKey' | base64 -d | xxd -p -c 32 | sed 's/^/0x/'
   ```

   And set it as `SP_PRIVATE_KEY` in your `.env` file. The value you store there
   must be this exported private key in 32-byte hex format with a `0x` prefix - **not** the wallet
   address you pass to `lotus wallet export`

5. Alternatively, generate an auth token for your _controller address_ and use it instead of the private key:

    ```bash
    lotus auth create-token --perm sign --wallet <your-controller-address>
    ```

   And set it as `SP_LOTUS_TOKEN` in your `.env` file alongside `SP_LOTUS_WALLET` with the address of your _controller wallet_. \
   Using this method, the private key never leaves the Lotus wallet and is not exposed to the CLI app.
   You must use _f410 address_ or _standard EVM address_ for this method.

6. Set your SP organization address in `.env`:

      ```bash
      # Organization address to manage SPs from
      # You must have the SP_PRIVATE_KEY of an organization controlling address set to perform SP management operations
      
      SP_ORGANIZATION=<your-controller-address>
      ```

7. Optional, but very useful for downloading the deal data: install `aria2`:
    - on Mac `brew install aria2`
    - on Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install aria2`
    - on Arch: `sudo pacman -S aria2`

8. Now you should be ready to run the tools.
    - to find deals allocated to you and ready to download / onboard:

      ```bash
      python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py sp get-deals ACTIVE
      ```

    - to download / onboard the deal that is allocated to you:

      ```bash
      python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py sp onboard-data <deal-id> --output-dir <dir-to-download-to>
      ``` 

    - get the deal allocation IDs:

      ```bash
      python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py sp get-allocations <deal-id>
      ``` 

    - and claim allocations for a deal:

      ```bash
      python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py sp claim-allocations {curio|boost} <deal-id> 
      ```

9. To get the full list of commands for the tooling:

    ```bash
    python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py sp --help
    ```

## Typical PoRep Market Client workflow

1. Follow the [Installation](#installation) steps.

2. Put your client keys in the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # Use `lotus wallet list` to see your wallets and their addresses and `lotus wallet new delegated` to create new delegated wallet
   # Must be delegated f410 address or standard EVM address
   CLIENT_LOTUS_WALLET=<lotus-wallet>
   
   # Generate this by running `lotus auth create-token --perm sign`
   CLIENT_LOTUS_TOKEN=<lotus-token>
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   # 32-byte raw private key (hex, 0x-prefixed)
   CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY=<private key>
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset with [Singularity](https://github.com/filecoin-project/singularity) (or equivalent) so you have a published **manifest URL** and piece
   CARs served for the SP to fetch.

4. Propose a deal from that manifest. Deals can be **public** (open retrieval) or **private** (retrieval limited to the deal owner and any wallets you later
   authorize with a voucher):

   ```bash
   python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py client propose-deal <manifest-url> \
     --price-per-tib-per-month <usdc-in-decimal-format> \
     --duration-months <months> \
     --retrievability-pct <pct> \
     --bandwidth-mbps <mbps> \
     --latency-ms <ms> \
     --indexing-pct <pct> \
     --deal-type <public|private>
   ```

5. Initialize payment (validator, deposit, rail):

   ```bash
   python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py client init-deal <deal-id>
   ```

6. Make DataCap allocations:

   ```bash
   python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py client make-allocations <deal-id>
   ```

7. Optional - for a **private** deal, sign an EIP-712 retrieval voucher so a third-party wallet can retrieve the data (used
   with [large-paid-retrievals](https://github.com/fidlabs/large-paid-retrievals)):

   ```bash
   python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py client sign-retrieval-voucher \
     --grantee <0x-third-party-wallet> \
     --scope <DEAL_ID>
   ```

   Prints a long-lived standalone `RetrievalVoucher` token (`grantee`, `scope`, `issuedAt`,
   `deadline`, embedded `signature`) for `Authorization: RetrievalVoucher`. \
   Clients mint a per-piece `RetrievalProof` and send it as `Authorization: RetrievalProof` —
   see [access-vouchers-eip712](https://github.com/fidlabs/large-paid-retrievals/blob/main/docs/access-vouchers-eip712.md). \
   `--deal-id` is accepted as an alias for `--scope`.

## FCSS repair flow (re-onboard a dataset from a healthy SP)

FCSS requires two SP copies of every dataset. When one SP exits, the client repairs the dataset by having a **new SP**
fetch the data from the **healthy SP** (the one holding the surviving copy) through a paid retrieval with
[large-paid-retrievals](https://github.com/fidlabs/large-paid-retrievals) (LPR), and onboard it under a new deal.
The client pays for that one-off retrieval up front, so the new SP never fronts the cost and no client keys are shared.

**How the retrieval payment works:** the LPR `sp-proxy` only accepts a Filecoin Pay one-time rail payment whose payer is
the wallet that signs the retrieval request, i.e. the wallet that downloads. So the client cannot pay the healthy SP
on the new SP's behalf. Instead, `client pay-repair-retrieval` (or `client propose-deal --repair`) makes a one-off
FileCoinPay `deposit` of the estimated retrieval cost **into the FileCoinPay account of the new SP's retrieval wallet**.
LPR `retrieval-client` spends available FileCoinPay funds before using any wallet balance, so the new SP's download is
paid by the client. The client's exposure is capped at the deposited amount; the deposit is separate from and in
addition to the regular deal payment rail (`client init-deal`).

1. **Healthy SP:** deploy LPR `sp-proxy` in front of its piece server with a flat `--price-usdfc-per-gb` rate, following
   [LPR for storage providers](https://github.com/fidlabs/large-paid-retrievals#for-storage-providers).

2. **New SP:** build LPR `retrieval-client`
   ([for dataset consumers](https://github.com/fidlabs/large-paid-retrievals#for-dataset-consumers)), put it in `PATH`
   or set `RETRIEVAL_CLIENT_PATH`, and create a dedicated retrieval wallet key (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32 > retrieval.key`).
   Send the client only its public `0x` address. The wallet needs a little FIL for Filecoin Pay gas.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fidlabs/large-paid-retrievals && cd large-paid-retrievals
   go build -o bin/retrieval-client ./cmd/retrieval-client
   ```

3. **Client:** prepare the repair manifest. It is the repaired deal's manifest, unchanged (same manifest hash), to be
   hosted on the healthy SP's host so that `sp onboard-data` downloads from there:

   ```bash
   python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py client repair-manifest <repaired-deal-id> --source-host <healthy-sp-host>
   ```

   Host the written file at the printed `repair_manifest_url`.

4. **Client:** propose the new deal with `--repair`. This checks the manifest matches the repaired deal before
   proposing, then deposits the retrieval cost for the new SP once the deal is created. The deposit only goes ahead if
   the deal is assigned to `--repair-provider-id`. To guarantee the provider, an admin can use
   `admin propose-deal-for-offer` with the new SP's offer, and the client then runs `client pay-repair-retrieval`.

   ```bash
   python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py client propose-deal <repair-manifest-url> ... \
     --repair \
     --repair-of <repaired-deal-id> \
     --repair-provider-id <new-sp-provider-id> \
     --repair-retrieval-wallet <new-sp-retrieval-wallet-0x> \
     --repair-price-per-gib <healthy-sp-price-usdfc-per-gb>
   ```

   The cost is estimated like the `sp-proxy` prices it: `ceil(fileSize / GiB) × price` per piece. Continue with
   `client init-deal` and `client make-allocations` as usual. `client pay-repair-retrieval <new-deal-id> ...` runs the
   deposit step on its own, e.g. to retry it.

5. **New SP:** onboard the data through LPR instead of aria2. Use `--port` for the healthy SP's `sp-proxy` port:

   ```bash
   python3 ./porep_tooling_cli.py sp onboard-data <new-deal-id> --output-dir <dir> \
     --downloader lpr --port 8787 --retrieval-key-file ./retrieval.key
   ```

   `retrieval-client` gets the CLI's `RPC_URL`, `FILECOIN_PAY` and the deal's payment token, so it spends from the same
   FileCoinPay account the client funded. In `tools/sp-pipeline.sh`, set `ONBOARD_DATA_DOWNLOADER="lpr"`,
   `ONBOARD_DATA_PORT` and `RETRIEVAL_KEY_FILE`.

Limitations:

- LPR currently lets only the deal owner retrieve **private** deals, so this flow works for **public** deals only. The
  `client sign-retrieval-voucher` integration depends on LPR's unmerged voucher-based access.
- The cost is an upfront estimate. If the `sp-proxy` quotes more, for example after a price change, `retrieval-client`
  covers the difference from the retrieval wallet's own USDFC, or fails if the wallet has none.

## Developing new CLI commands

- See files in `cli/commands` for examples of how to implement new commands.
- Keep the code clean and simple, follow the existing patterns and best practices.
- Use `Exception` (`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`, ...) for internal-like errors (things that "should not happen")
  and `click.ClickException` for user-like errors (things that happens "because of the user").
- Use `click.echo` for all user-facing output and `logger` for file logging.
- For read-only commands, print the output in json format for easy parsing by other tools.
